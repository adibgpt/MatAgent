1. 1. **Introduction**: The report investigates the correlation between gravimetric and molar heat capacities across various temperatures, hypothesizing a correlation between them. The objective is to understand this relationship using statistical analysis and visualization.
2. 2. **Hypothesis**: The report hypothesizes that gravimetric and molar heat capacities are correlated across different temperatures.
3. 3. **Methodology**: The dataset 'IZA_cp.csv' was cleaned and preprocessed, followed by analysis using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps to explore relationships between variables. Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib were used.
4. 4. **Results**: The analysis showed a positive trend in scatter plots, indicating a potential linear relationship, which was confirmed by the correlation heatmap showing strong positive correlations at various temperatures.
5. 5. **Discussion**: The study's findings support the hypothesis, highlighting significant correlations that underscore the importance of considering both types of heat capacities in material analysis.
6. 6. **Conclusion**: The analysis confirms the hypothesis, with implications for understanding material properties in scientific and industrial applications.
7. 7. **References**: The report includes references to relevant literature in APA style.
