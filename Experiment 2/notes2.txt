### Research Hypotheses

1. **Hypothesis 1: Material Composition and Critical Temperature**
   - **Statement**: There exists a significant relationship between the elemental composition of superconducting materials and their critical temperatures (Tc). Specifically, certain combinations of elements will yield higher Tc values.
   - **Feasibility**: This hypothesis is feasible as it can be tested using statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to identify correlations between material compositions and their respective Tc values.
   - **References**: 
     - "Superconductivity: A Very Short Introduction" by Stephen Blundell.
     - "The Physics of Superconductors" by Peter J. Hirschfeld.

2. **Hypothesis 2: Feature Importance in Predicting Superconductivity**
   - **Statement**: Machine learning models can accurately predict the critical temperature of superconductors based on their material properties, with specific features (e.g., atomic radius, electronegativity) being more influential than others.
   - **Feasibility**: This hypothesis can be tested using regression models and feature importance analysis (e.g., SHAP values) to determine which features contribute most to the predictions.
   - **References**: 
     - "Machine Learning in Materials Science" by Jha et al. (2018).
     - "Feature Selection for High-Dimensional Data: A Fast Correlation-Based Filter Solution" by Hall and Holmes.

3. **Hypothesis 3: Design of New Superconducting Materials**
   - **Statement**: By applying generative machine learning techniques, it is possible to design new superconducting materials with desired critical temperatures by optimizing the elemental composition and structure.
   - **Feasibility**: This hypothesis is innovative and feasible, leveraging techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) or reinforcement learning to explore the material design space.
   - **References**: 
     - "Generative Models for Materials Design" by Xie and Grossman (2018).
     - "Deep Learning for Materials Science" by Bartók et al. (2017).

### Steps to Test Hypotheses

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset `superconduct_train new.csv`.
   - Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and normalize features.

   - Use correlation matrices and scatter plots to identify potential relationships.

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Apply statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA, chi-square) to identify significant features.
   - Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Lasso Regression) to rank feature importance.

4. **Model Development**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict Tc.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE and R².

5. **Generative Modeling**:
   - Implement generative models to explore new material compositions.
   - Use optimization techniques to identify compositions that maximize Tc.

6. **Visualization and Reporting**:
   - Create detailed graphical reports showcasing feature importance, model performance, and potential new materials.
