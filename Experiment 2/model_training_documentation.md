1. Load the necessary libraries for machine learning.
2. Select a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor).
3. Train the model using the training data.
4. Evaluate the model using the testing data and calculate performance metrics (e.g., R^2 score, Mean Absolute Error).
5. Document the results and findings.
