- These studies underscore the potential of integrating machine learning with theoretical models to improve predictions of yield strength in alloys, thus supporting the research hypothesis.
- Recent studies have identified the electronic density of states (DOS) as a critical factor in determining the mechanical properties of alloys. Low occupancy at the Fermi level is associated with strong bonds and high elastic constants, which are indicative of higher yield strength. Studies on Ir-Rh and AlSi alloys have further explored these relationships, providing insights into the role of lattice dynamics and force constants in alloy performance.
