1. # Introduction


This study employs a systematic experimental approach to evaluate optimization strategies for perovskite solar cells. The experimental setup includes the fabrication of perovskite solar cell samples with varying configurations to test the effects of different parameters, such as layer thickness, material composition, and interface engineering. 

Sample sizes for each configuration are standardized at 10 cells per batch to ensure statistical significance. Controls include standard perovskite solar cells without optimization to serve as a baseline for comparison. 

Analytical techniques involve the use of photovoltaic performance measurements, such as current-voltage (I-V) characterization, to assess efficiency improvements. Additionally, advanced simulation tools, like TCAD (Technology Computer-Aided Design), are utilized to model the impact of different parameters on cell efficiency, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms of observed improvements.
Recent advancements in perovskite solar cell technology have led to significant improvements in efficiency. Notable studies include the work of Thiesbrummel et al. (2022), which focuses on minimizing open-circuit voltage losses in all-perovskite tandem photovoltaics, achieving a stabilized efficiency of 23.7%. Additionally, Ahmad et al. (2022) utilize machine learning to predict the formability and classify the crystal structure of ABO3 type perovskites, facilitating accelerated development of efficient photovoltaic materials.
Perovskite solar cells have emerged as a promising technology in the field of renewable energy due to their high efficiency and low production costs. The research community has focused on optimizing various parameters to enhance the performance of these solar cells. This report explores the optimization strategies for perovskite solar cells, with a particular emphasis on minimizing parasitic resistances and non-radiative recombination losses. The hypothesis driving this study is that optimizing these parameters can significantly improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells.
