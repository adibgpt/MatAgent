### Research Hypothesis

**Hypothesis 1:** Machine learning models can accurately predict the experimental band gap of materials based on their structural and electronic properties, with a focus on achieving a high coefficient of determination (R²) and minimizing mean squared error (MSE).

### Steps to Test the Hypothesis

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Load the dataset from `data.csv` which contains features related to materials and their corresponding experimental band gaps.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.
   - Normalize or standardize the features if necessary.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Identify the most relevant features that influence the band gap using techniques such as correlation analysis or feature importance from tree-based models.

4. **Model Selection:**
   - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for regression tasks, such as:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest Regressor
     - Gradient Boosting Regressor
     - Support Vector Regressor

5. **Model Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).
   - Train the selected models on the training set.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the models using R² and MSE metrics on the testing set.
   - Compare the performance of different models to identify the best-performing one.

7. **Visualization:**
   - Create visualizations to illustrate the R² and MSE of each model.
   - Plot predicted vs. actual values to visually assess model performance.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Analyze the results to determine if the hypothesis is supported by the data.

### Feasibility and Uniqueness

- **Feasibility:** The hypothesis is feasible as machine learning techniques are well-established for regression tasks, and there are numerous libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow) available for implementation.
- **Uniqueness:** While predicting band gaps is a common task in materials science, the specific combination of features and machine learning models used in this study may yield unique insights and results.

The Python code for loading the dataset, preprocessing it, training machine learning models, and evaluating their performance has been developed. Below is the code that accomplishes these tasks, including visualizations for R² and MSE.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor
from sklearn.svm import SVR
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Preprocessing
# Assuming the target variable is 'experimental_band_gap' and the rest are features
X = data.drop('experimental_band_gap', axis=1)
y = data['experimental_band_gap']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize models
models = {
    'Linear Regression': LinearRegression(),
    'Random Forest': RandomForestRegressor(),
    'Gradient Boosting': GradientBoostingRegressor(),
    'Support Vector Regressor': SVR()
}

# Store results
results = {}

# Train and evaluate each model
for name, model in models.items():
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
    
    results[name] = {'MSE': mse, 'R²': r2}

# Convert results to DataFrame for easier plotting
results_df = pd.DataFrame(results).T

# Visualization of R² and MSE
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

# Create a bar plot for R²
sns.barplot(x=results_df.index, y='R²', data=results_df, ax=ax1, color='b', alpha=0.6, label='R²')
ax1.set_ylabel('R²', color='b')
ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='b')

# Create a second y-axis for MSE
ax2 = ax1.twinx()
sns.barplot(x=results_df.index, y='MSE', data=results_df, ax=ax2, color='r', alpha=0.6, label='MSE')
ax2.set_ylabel('MSE', color='r')
ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor='r')

# Title and legend
plt.title('Model Performance: R² and MSE')
fig.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('model_performance.png')
plt.show()

# Predicted vs Actual values for the best model (e.g., Random Forest)
best_model = RandomForestRegressor()
best_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_best_pred = best_model.predict(X_test)

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(y_test, y_best_pred, alpha=0.7)
plt.plot([y.min(), y.max()], [y.min(), y.max()], 'k--', lw=2)
plt.xlabel('Actual Values')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Values')
plt.title('Predicted vs Actual Values (Random Forest)')
plt.savefig('predicted_vs_actual.png')
plt.show()
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The dataset is loaded, and the target variable is separated from the features.
2. **Model Training:** Four different regression models are trained on the training set.
3. **Evaluation Metrics:** The Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score are calculated for each model.
4. **Visualization:** Two visualizations are created:
   - A bar plot showing the R² and MSE for each model.
   - A scatter plot comparing predicted vs. actual values for the best-performing model (Random Forest in this case).

### Next Steps:
- Execute the code to generate the visualizations and save them as files named 'model_performance.png' and 'predicted_vs_actual.png'.
- Ensure the saved files are organized in the working directory for easy access.
