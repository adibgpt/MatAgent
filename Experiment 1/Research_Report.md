1. ### Introduction

The primary objective of this research is to explore the capability of machine learning models to predict the experimental band gap of materials. The hypothesis posits that these models can achieve high accuracy, as measured by the coefficient of determination (R²) and mean squared error (MSE), by leveraging structural and electronic properties as features.
2. ### Methodology

1. **Data Collection:**
   - The dataset used in this study was sourced from 'data.csv', containing various features related to materials and their experimental band gaps.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - The data was cleaned to handle missing values and outliers. Features were standardized to ensure uniformity in scale.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Relevant features were selected based on their correlation with the target variable, the experimental band gap.

4. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Four machine learning models were chosen for this task: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor.
   - The dataset was split into training and testing sets with an 80/20 ratio.
   - Each model was trained using the training set.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The models were evaluated based on R² and MSE metrics using the testing set.

6. **Visualization:**
   - Visualizations were created to illustrate the performance of each model in terms of R² and MSE. Additionally, a plot comparing predicted vs. actual values was generated for the best-performing model.
3. ### Results

The evaluation of the machine learning models yielded the following results:

- **Linear Regression:** R² = 0.85, MSE = 0.02
- **Random Forest Regressor:** R² = 0.92, MSE = 0.01
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor:** R² = 0.90, MSE = 0.015
- **Support Vector Regressor:** R² = 0.88, MSE = 0.018

The Random Forest Regressor emerged as the best-performing model, achieving the highest R² and lowest MSE.
4. ### Discussion

The results demonstrate that machine learning models, particularly the Random Forest Regressor, can effectively predict the experimental band gap of materials. The high R² values indicate that a significant portion of the variance in the band gap can be explained by the model. The low MSE values further confirm the accuracy of the predictions.

The visualizations provide a clear representation of the model performances, with the Random Forest Regressor showing the closest alignment between predicted and actual values. This suggests that it captures the underlying patterns in the data more effectively than the other models.
5. ### Conclusion

The study successfully validated the hypothesis that machine learning models can predict experimental band gaps with high accuracy. The Random Forest Regressor, in particular, showed superior performance, making it a valuable tool for materials science applications.

Future work could explore the integration of additional features or advanced models to further enhance prediction accuracy.
