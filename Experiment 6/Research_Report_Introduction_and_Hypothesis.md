1. **Introduction**
2. The construction industry is a major contributor to global carbon emissions, with cement production alone accounting for a significant portion of these emissions. In response to environmental concerns, there is a growing interest in optimizing concrete mix designs to enhance sustainability while maintaining structural integrity. Recent advances in machine learning offer promising avenues for optimizing concrete mixtures by predicting properties such as compressive strength based on mix composition.
3. This research focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to optimize concrete mix designs. By integrating data-driven models, the study aims to identify key factors that influence the compressive strength of concrete and to propose optimal mix designs that balance performance with environmental impact.
4. **Hypothesis**
5. The hypothesis of this study is that machine learning can effectively identify the optimal proportions of concrete mix components to maximize compressive strength while minimizing environmental impact. It is anticipated that through the application of advanced algorithms, such as Bayesian Optimization and probabilistic modeling, more sustainable and efficient concrete mix designs can be developed.
